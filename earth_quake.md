# Earthquake Data Retrieval Project

This project retrieves earthquake data from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) and stores it in a CSV file. The data collected includes information on earthquakes that occurred in the last 15 days, such as the time, location, type, magnitude, latitude, longitude, and depth of each earthquake. The data is then saved into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Features
- **Fetch Earthquake Data**: Retrieve earthquake data from the past 15 days using the USGS API.
- **Save to CSV**: Save the earthquake data into a CSV file.
- **Data Fields**: The data includes the time, place, magnitude, latitude, longitude, depth, and earthquake type.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **requests library**: For making HTTP requests to the USGS API.
- **pandas library**: For handling and storing the data in CSV format.
